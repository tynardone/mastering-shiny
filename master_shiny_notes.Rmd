```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Shiny Workflow

Every app will start with the same six lines of code: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage(
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

This boilerplate can be added with a couple different shorcuts:
<ul>
<li>If you have app.R open type `shinyapp` and then `Shift` + `tab`</li>
<li>If you are starting a new project, go File -> "New Project" -> "Shiny Web Application"</li>
</ul>
